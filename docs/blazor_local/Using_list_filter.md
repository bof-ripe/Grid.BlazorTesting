# Using a list filter

[Index](Documentation.md)

There can be columns where their values can only be selected from a short list. 
You can use an special filter based on a list for those columns. 
It looks like:

In order to use a list filter you have to create a list of ```SelectItem``` objects in the ```OnParametersSetAsync``` method of the razor page:

```c#
    ...
    var shippers = shipperService.GetAllShippers();
    ...
``` 

Then you have to add the column using the ```SetListFilter``` method of the ```GridColumn``` object:
```c#
    c.Add(o => o.ShipVia)
        .RenderValueAs(o => o.Shipper.CompanyName)
        .SetListFilter(shippers, true, true);
```
